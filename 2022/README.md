# Project structure

Each day can be found in it's own `dayXX` directory, the two parts of each question are then split into
`DayXXa.java` & `dayXXb.java` respectively. The solutions are organized as a cli, where you provide the
input, day and part and the process is started.
```bash
# Example for day 11
java -cp out Main 11 1
```
