# Advent of Code Solutions

Welcome to my Advent of Code solutions repository! Each year, I take on the challenge of solving Advent of Code puzzles in a different programming language or technology as a way to learn and broaden my skills. Currently, the solutions for the year 2023 are implemented in Golang.

## Advent of Code

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an annual event where coding challenges are released each day leading up to Christmas. It's a great opportunity for programmers to improve their problem-solving skills and explore new programming languages and concepts.
