# Project structure

Each day can be found in it's own `dayXX` directory, the two parts of each question are then split into
`dayXXa.go` & `dayXXb.go` respectively. To run a daily solution navigate to it's directory and run:
```bash
# Example for day 7
go run day07a.go
```

You can find the description for each problem at the top of each solution file:
```go
// Description: https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/1
```

In each directory you can also find a `dayXX-answers.txt` with every part's answers.
